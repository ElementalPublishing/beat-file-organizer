# Beat File Organizer - Ideas & Strategic Roadmap

This document captures all strategic, technical, and feature ideas for the Beat File Organizer project, organized by priority and implementation phase.

## üéØ Core Mission
Build the ultimate Beat File Organizer for music producers - a tool that solves real workflow pain points around scattered, duplicate, and versioned music files, with potential to evolve into a comprehensive producer-focused platform.

---

## üìã Immediate Priorities (Phase 1)

### File Organization Engine
- **Complete `/api/organize` endpoint**: Implement actual file organization based on user GUI decisions
- **100% duplicate detection**: Use waveform comparison instead of just file hashes for true audio duplicate detection
- **File protection logic**: Never auto-delete files with keywords like "master", "final", "release", "published"
- **Safe organization patterns**: Always copy/move to organized structure, never delete originals

### Immediate Workflow Enhancements
- **Smart file suggestions**: Automatically detect and suggest organization patterns based on existing folder structure
- **Duplicate handling options**: Give users multiple choices for handling duplicates (keep both, keep newest, manual review)
- **Filename cleaning**: Automatically fix common naming issues (remove extra spaces, fix capitalization, standardize separators)
- **Metadata preservation**: Ensure all audio metadata is preserved during file operations
- **Operation logging**: Keep detailed logs of all file operations for troubleshooting and undo functionality
- **Disk space awareness**: Show disk usage and available space before operations
- **Fast scan mode**: Quick scan option that only checks file sizes and basic metadata
- **Custom ignore patterns**: Let users specify files/folders to always ignore during scans

### User Experience Improvements
- **Batch operations**: Allow users to select multiple files/groups for organization
- **Smart grouping suggestions**: Automatically suggest organization patterns based on file names and metadata
- **Undo functionality**: Track all operations to allow reversal
- **Progress indicators**: Better real-time feedback during long operations
- **Drag & drop interface**: Visual file organization with intuitive drag/drop
- **Preview mode**: Show what the organization will look like before applying changes
- **Custom organization rules**: Let users define their own naming and folder patterns
- **Conflict resolution UI**: Handle naming conflicts and duplicate destinations gracefully
